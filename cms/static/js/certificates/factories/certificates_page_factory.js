/**
 * The basic idea of the page factories is that they are a single RequireJS dependency that can be loaded to create a page. This was put in place for RequireJS Optimizer, which needs to have a single root to determine statically all of the dependencies needed by a page. Optimizer takes all of the dependencies and puts them into a single optimized JS file.
 * You'll see that the Mako templates typically have a block that constructs the page using the factory
 * We write unit tests for them to verify that they behave as desired. Some of them are more complex than others.
 * RequireJS Optimizer is only enabled in Studio at the moment, so the factories aren't strictly required in the LMS. We do intend to enable it on the LMS too
